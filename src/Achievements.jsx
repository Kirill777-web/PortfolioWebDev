            <p>
              As an Object Storage Specialist with a focus on AWS, I have honed
              my skills in managing and utilizing AWS S3, the industry-leading
              scalable object storage solution. My expertise encompasses setting
              up, securing, and optimizing S3 buckets to ensure high
              availability and cost-effectiveness. I am adept at implementing
              lifecycle policies, versioning, and cross-region replication to
              meet diverse data storage requirements.

            <p>
              Hey there! Just wanted to share some exciting news. I have wrapped
              up my IT-support Coursera certification with Google (yay!). This
              was not just about reading books; I dived deep into hands-on
              stuffâ€”think building computers, setting up networks, and even
              delving into the world of Linux and Binary Code. So, if you have
              got tech troubles or just want to chat about the Command-Line
              Interface, I am your person!
